## Purpose 
The idea was to create an aimbot that could be used across a wide variety of games simply by training a neural network on images of whatever game you choose. Additionally, because of anti-cheat measures being able to detect mouse injections or software emulated mouse movements, an ESP432-S2 was implemented in order to act as an external mouse. 

## Features 
* Efficient screen capturing
* Mouse Movement from external ESP32-S2
* GPU-accelerated neural network inference for enemy/target detection (NVIDIA GPUs only)
* Aim Location Selection 
* Detection Region Selection 
* ML Vision Display
